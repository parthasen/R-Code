Some fun data analysis while I learn R and statistics

## Premier League 2012-2013
### Which team 'draws' the most red cards from opposition teams ?

Which teams recieve the most red cards compared with how many red cards their opposition receives.

e.g Man Utd only received 1 red card during the season, but their opposition teams received 4 when playing against them

### £10 Weekly win bet
If you put a £10 win bet on your favourite team, how would you fare by the end of the season

![2012-2013](projects/premier_league/2012_Man_United_weekly_10_pound_bet_season.jpeg)

You would have finished up with winnings of €379.30 and so made a €0.70 loss

If you put that bet on Liverpool

You would have finished up with winnings of €240 and so made a €140 loss

### £10 weekly bet account balance
If you put on a £10 win bet on your favourite team each match, but used an account balance to hold your betting funds, how much would be in the account at the end of the season, and how much would you have to put in to keep enough money in it to put on a weekly £10.

When you win a bet, you get your winnings and your stake back, all that money goes back into your account and so contributes to the balance. 

If we track Man Utd, you will end the season with an account balance of £489.30 only having had to put in £50

If you track Chelsea, you will end up with an account balance of £371.80 again only having had only to put in a total of £10

### Year on Year £10 weekly bet balance
If you put a £10 win bet on your favourite team each match, and used your account balance to hold your betting funds, how would you be doing this year compared to last year.

#### Man United
Amazingly given the season start they have had, you would infact be ricer at this point in the season than you would have been last year
